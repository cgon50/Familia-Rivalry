What sort of app are we building? What will be the major subsystems? What will be the major challenges? 
This app will function similar to family feud. It will have a user login and questions we likely create with answers pulled from the google autocomplete API. The answers will be the top suggested queries with a given search prefix. We will also have multiplayer so you can challenge your nearby friends. Multiplayer, and either creating questions or finding a way to scrape actual family feud questions, will be the trickiest portion of the project.

Major UI elements:

   

Week by week schedule:
Week 1: Layout
Week 2: Question creation / scraping
Week 3: Game Logic
Week 4: Authentication / Multiplayer
Week 5:  Multiplayer
Week 6: Polish UI, attempt voice to text.

APIs
RealTimeMultiplayerClient
GoogleSignInAccount / FirebaseAuth
Possibly SpeechRecognizer
Google Autocomplete API

Deliverable:
We will demo our working app, where we will play a couple rounds to showcase the different paths that our app can take, and how it handles. 

Inspiration:
This will be a crossover of family feud and google feud. It will take the competitive format of family feud and use the same methods of drawing questions as google feud does.
